Careminds Screening – Phase 2: Full-Stack Portfolio Management
Hello Felipe, and congratulations on moving forward in our screening process.
This next step focuses on evaluating your full-stack development skills using Node.js and Next.js.

You will extend the application from the first phase into a complete full-stack solution, adding authentication, backend APIs, and data persistence. You are expected to design the backend logic, integrate it with your existing frontend, and deliver a maintainable, scalable application.

Objective
Transform the portfolio viewer into a full-stack application where users can:

Log in securely

Manage multiple wallets

Add, edit, and remove assets

Persist and calculate financial data dynamically

Requirements
Authentication

Implement a basic authentication system (email/password is acceptable).

Allow users to log in and log out.

Protect private data (wallets and assets) behind authentication.

Backend

Use Node.js with Next.js API routes or a custom Node.js server.

You may use JSON Server or a NoSQL database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).

Store all wallet and asset data on the backend.

Wallet Management

Users must be able to create, edit, and delete wallets.

Each wallet must include:

Name

Current balance (calculated)

Spent amount

Profit/Loss (calculated from assets)

Asset Management

Users must be able to create, edit, and delete assets within a wallet.

Each asset should include:

Type (e.g., stock, crypto)

Symbol

Name

Quantity

Purchase price

Current price

Calculations

Automatically calculate:

Total value of each wallet

Individual asset gain/loss

Overall profit/loss per wallet

Display wallet summaries and asset details in the UI

Delivery
Use the current GitHub repository and share access with us.

Include clear setup instructions to run the application locally (both front-end and back-end).

Ensure the authentication system is functional and the application behaves as expected.

The user interface should be clean, usable, and well-structured.

Deadline and Time Estimate
This task is expected to take approximately 5 to 6 hours to complete.
You have 7 calendar days from the time you receive this message to deliver the final result.
